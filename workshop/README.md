## Introduction to the workshop

If you want to learn in-depth about containers technology using OpenShift, this workshop is a good place to start. Use the menu to the left to navigate through this Gitbook.

* **Lab 1** - During this workshop, you will build, ship, and run a Node.JS-based container with a language translation microservice utilizing IBM Watson for the translation.

* **Lab 2** - You will do a short exercise to ship an existing image from a public container registry and deploy it in a Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud.

* **Lab 3** - You will create a container project, ship it to an internal Container Registry, and run the project in a Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud.

* **Next steps** - You will explore other labs using a minishift environment on a regular laptop. We also include more materials and references for further study.

Good luck! We hope you like this workshop!
