# Claiming Your Red Hat OpenShift Cluster for This Workshop

You will need to access a free pre-provisioned cluster for this workshop and optionally the cloud shell environment instead of the local one.

## Claim your cluster

For the purpose of this workshop, organizers have pre-provisioned for attendees free Red Hat OpenShift Clusters. The specification of these Red Hat OpenShift clusters is as follows:

```console
1 Worker Node
Each worker node has 4 CPU cores with 16GB of RAM
The abbreviated description:
1 x 4 x 16
```
